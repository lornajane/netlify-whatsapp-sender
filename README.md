# Integrate Anything with WhatsApp

This repo holds a Netlify function in NodeJS that integrates with [Vonage Messages API](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/overview) to send WhatsApp messages.

You will need:

* A [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/signup)
* A [Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?utm_source=DEV_REL&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=ifttt-netlify)
* The details of your WhatsApp Business account - or you can use the [Messages Sandbox](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/sandbox?utm_source=DEV_REL&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=ifttt-netlify) to try things out if you don't have one.
